## The Problem
Clinics in Indonesia face a "Double Burden": they must manage complex business operations (drug inventory, patient billing) while strictly adhering to the Ministry of Health's mandate to sync all patient data with the **SatuSehat** platform. Doing this manually is impossible, leading to compliance risks and operational bottlenecks.

## The Solution
I engineered **Benning Clinic**, a compliant ERP designed to bridge internal operations with national standards.

- **Automated Compliance:** The system automatically syncs Patient, Practitioner, and Encounter data to the Ministry of Health's platform in the background, ensuring 100% regulatory compliance without extra administrative work.
- **Integrated Clinical Operations:** Features a full **Electronic Medical Record (EMR)** system with ICD-10 diagnosis tracking and medical photo documentation.
- **Pharmacy & Finance:** A unified loop where a doctor's prescription automatically deducts inventory (FIFO) and generates a double-entry accounting journal for financial tracking.

## Engineering Highlight: FHIR Interoperability Engine
The technical core is the **HL7 FHIR Transformation Layer** in `SatuSehatService.php`.

- **The Challenge:** The Ministry of Health uses the **HL7 FHIR** standard—a notoriously complex, deeply nested JSON format that does not match standard relational database structures.
- **The Logic:** I built a **Data Mapper** that transforms flat SQL models (Patients, Rooms) into recursive FHIR resources. It handles complex logic like mapping administrative codes (Province/City) to specific URLs and nesting extensions deeply within the JSON payload.
- **Resilience:** Implemented a robust **OAuth2 Token Manager** with Redis caching to handle session expiration gracefully, ensuring zero downtime during API syncs.
