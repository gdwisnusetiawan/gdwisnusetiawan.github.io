## **Real-World Impact**

Unlike theoretical projects, Uptoo is a living system powering daily operations for:

- **Medical Distribution:** PT. EDM & CV. DSU (Managing medical equipment inventory for hospitals/clinics).
- **Automotive Services:** Nevel (Premium Motorbike Wash).
- **Retail & F&B:** OGOOD (Health Foods), Teman Makan Bali (Food Influencer), Benelove (Dessert Foods).

## **The Problem**

Service-based businesses (like auto detailing) and distributors (like medical suppliers) have fundamentally different workflows, yet both suffer from the same "Software Disconnect": their POS doesn't talk to their Inventory, and their Inventory doesn't talk to their Accounting. This forces owners to manually reconcile 3 different systems, leading to financial leaks and stock discrepancies.

## **The Solution**

I engineered **Uptoo**, a unified ERP architecture adaptable to both **Service** and **Distribution** models.

- **Hybrid POS System:** Handles mixed-basket transactions (e.g., selling a physical helmet + a washing service) in a single checkout flow, linked directly to a customer's specific vehicle history.
- **Automated General Ledger:** Operational transactions (Sales/Purchases) automatically generate double-entry journals, ensuring the Balance Sheet and P&L are updated in real-time without manual accountant intervention.
- **Batch-Aware Inventory:** Supports complex stock logic including batch tracking and expiry alerts—crucial for both medical supplies (EDM/DSU) and perishable retail goods (OGOOD).

## **Engineering Highlight: Dynamic Polymorphic Reporting**

The system's intelligence lies in the **ReportController** engine.

- **The Challenge:** Different stakeholders need different data views. A CEO wants a visual margin chart, while an auditor needs a raw 10,000-row Excel dump.
- **The Logic:** I built a **Dual-Mode Aggregation Engine**. It accepts dynamic criteria (Date Range, Product Category, Branch) and seamlessly switches output modes. It can render raw JSON for frontend widgets or server-side **DataTables** responses for heavy grid views.
- **Complexity:** It performs real-time margin calculations by joining `Sales` → `Details` → `Products` → `Promos` on the fly, deriving Net Profit without storing redundant calculated columns in the database.
