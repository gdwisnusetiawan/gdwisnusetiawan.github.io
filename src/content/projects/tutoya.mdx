## **The Problem**

Many e-commerce templates handle the "buying" part well but fail at the "post-purchase" experience. Merchants waste hours manually checking bank transfers against orders, and customers are left in the dark about shipping costs and tracking numbers, leading to high support ticket volumes.

## **The Solution**

I engineered **TUTOYA**, a retail-first platform focused on operational transparency.

- **Automated Checkout Logic:** The system validates stock in real-time and calculates precise shipping costs across 3 major couriers (JNE, POS, TIKI) based on cart weight, ensuring the merchant never loses money on shipping underestimations.
- **Self-Service Customer Dashboard:** Users have a dedicated portal to manage their entire lifecycle: checking order status, uploading payment proofs for verification, and downloading PDF invoices.
- **Integrated Last-Mile Tracking:** Unlike standard shops that just email a tracking number, TUTOYA integrates directly with courier APIs to show shipment progress (e.g., J&T status) inside the user's dashboard.

## **Engineering Highlight: The Shipping Aggregation Gateway**

The technical core is the **Multi-Provider Logistics Gateway** in the `CheckoutController`.

- **The Challenge:** Different couriers (JNE, POS, TIKI) use different API structures and response formats. Hardcoding them leads to brittle code.
- **The Logic:** I built a **Logistics Transformer** that accepts dynamic inputs (Origin, Destination, Weight) and queries multiple external APIs asynchronously. It normalizes the dissimilar JSON responses into a standardized "Shipping Option" object for the frontend. This abstraction layer means the UI never breaks, even if an API changes its response format.
