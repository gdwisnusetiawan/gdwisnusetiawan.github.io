## **The Problem**

Standard HR platforms are rigid. Recruiters can manage applicants, but they rely on IT/Marketing to update the "Careers" page. Every time they want to change a banner or add a "Culture" section, it requires a developer ticket, slowing down the hiring process.

## **The Solution**

I engineered **HumanVue**, a system that decouples content from code.

- **The "No-Code" Career Builder:** I built a dynamic CMS where admins can drag-and-drop "Blocks" (e.g., Hero, Testimonials, Job Grid) to construct their landing pages.
- **Full-Cycle ATS:** A comprehensive Applicant Tracking System that manages candidates from "Applied" to "Hired" with granular filtering.
- **Master Data Control:** Centralized management for multi-company structures, allowing a single parent group to manage hiring for multiple subsidiaries.

## **Engineering Highlight: The Dynamic Block Architecture**

The technical differentiator is the **File-System Discovery Engine** in `SectionController`.

- **The Challenge:** How to allow users to create infinite page variations without storing HTML in the database (which is insecure and hard to maintain).
- **The Logic:** I implemented a scanner that dynamically reads Blade templates from the `resources/views/layouts/blocks` directory. It exposes these templates as selectable "Options" in the UI. When a page renders, the system loops through the configured blocks and injects the specific Blade component on the fly.
- **Why it matters:** It turns a static Laravel app into a dynamic Website Builder.
