## **My Role & Contributions**

I focus on maintaining and enhancing the core backend services, ensuring reliability for thousands of concurrent users. My work logs (2022-2026) highlight three main areas of impact:

**1. Third-Party Integrations (Accurate Accounting)**
I was a key contributor to the **ERP Integration Module**, specifically bridging McEasy's logistics data with **Accurate** (a major Indonesian accounting software).

- **Feature:** Implemented endpoints to sync "Delivery Orders" (DO) and "Customers" between systems.
- **Complexity:** Handled data consistency challenges, such as syncing invoice numbers and ensuring strict validation when creating DOs from external sources.

**2. Core Logistics Engine (Fleet & Order Management)**
I actively maintain the "Fleet" and "Order" microservices.

- **Bulk Operations:** Developed features for **Bulk Status Updates** (Picked/Dropped), allowing fleet managers to process hundreds of orders in one click.
- **Reporting:** Optimized the "Reporting Endpoint" to include granular Vendor data, enabling better performance tracking for third-party transporters.
- **Data Integrity:** Regularly patched "Data Race" conditions and fixed complex validation bugs in the "Driver" and "Vehicle" assignment logic.

**3. Quality Assurance & Internal Tooling**

- **Code Quality:** I am heavily involved in **ICR (Internal Code Review)**, reviewing peer code to ensure it meets strict architectural standards before deployment.
- **E2E Testing:** I write and maintain End-to-End API tests (Order Service) to prevent regression in critical logistics flows.
