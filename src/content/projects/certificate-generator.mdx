## The Problem
University faculty faced a significant administrative bottleneck: manually evaluating thousands of student activities (from seminars to leadership roles) against standardized soft skill requirements. The process was subjective, prone to error, and time-consuming, requiring staff to manually calculate "points" across different scopes (National vs. Local) and levels.

## The Solution
I engineered a **Role-Based Certification Platform** that digitizes the entire lifecycle of soft skill validation.

- **Automated Logic:** Students simply upload evidence; the system automatically maps these inputs against a complex matrix of requirements to determine eligibility.
- **Dynamic Generation:** Replaced manual printing with a programmatic PDF engine (TCPDF) that generates official certificates on-the-fly, stamping them with dynamic signatures and unique validation IDs.
- **Legacy Robustness:** Built a custom compatibility layer (`mysql_` shim) allowing this native codebase to deploy securely on modern PHP 7+ infrastructure without a full rewrite.

## Engineering Highlight
The core innovation is a custom **Multi-Dimensional Intersection Algorithm** located in the `c_sertifikat.php` class.

- **The Challenge:** Mapping is not 1-to-1. A "Chairperson" role at a "National Event" satisfies higher competency requirements than a "Member" at a "Local Event."
- **The Logic:** I implemented a hierarchy processing engine that loops through defining tables (`posisi`, `ruang_lingkup`) to find attribute matches. It features a **deduplication algorithm** that intelligently filters results—if a student qualifies for both "Level 1" and "Level 2" Leadership, the system automatically prioritizes the highest achievement to ensure the certificate reflects their best work.
