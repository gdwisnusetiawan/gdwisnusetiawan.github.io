## **The Problem**

Small to medium business owners often feel trapped by static websites. Simple updates—like changing a phone number or adding a new portfolio item—usually require hiring a developer. Furthermore, inbound leads often get lost in spam folders because there is no centralized system to validate and store visitor inquiries.

## **The Solution**

I engineered **Trackscope**, a bespoke CMS designed for autonomy.

- **Dynamic Landing Pages:** The frontend is not hardcoded. It dynamically renders the "Hero" banner, "About Us" section, and "Service" cards based on real-time database entries.
- **Secure Admin Dashboard:** A protected backend allows non-technical staff to perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their business portfolio and services.
- **Lead Capture Engine:** Integrated a visitor inquiry system fortified with **Google reCAPTCHA** to block bots, storing valid leads directly in an admin inbox for immediate follow-up.

## **Engineering Highlight: The Unified State Aggregator**

The technical standout is the **Single-Request Data Aggregation** pattern in the `GuestController`.

- **The Challenge:** A rich "Single Page Application" feel often requires dozens of API calls to fetch profiles, galleries, contacts, and services, causing slow load times.
- **The Logic:** I implemented a unified aggregation query in the `index()` method. It eagerly loads **seven unique data models** (Profile, Content, Gallery, etc.) in a single controller action.
- **Memory vs. Database:** Instead of hitting the database repeatedly, I utilized **Laravel Collections** to filter data in-memory. For example, the system fetches all contacts once, then uses `>where('layout', 'social media')` to extract specific channels (like WhatsApp) programmatically. This reduces database stress and ensures the landing page loads instantly.
