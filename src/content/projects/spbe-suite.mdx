## **The Problem**

City governments (Kominfo/Bappeda) struggled with fragmented governance.

- **Subjective Planning:** Departments (OPDs) proposed budget-heavy apps without objective justification.
- **Siloed Monitoring:** There was no centralized way to track "Planned" vs. "Realized" IT assets across 8 different domains (Infrastructure, Security, Apps, etc.).
- **Manual Audits:** Measuring the government's "Digital Maturity Index" was a manual, spreadsheet-heavy nightmare.

## **The Solution**

I engineered a **Unified Laravel-Based Suite** consisting of three integrated modules:

- **The Planning Module:** A proposal system featuring an **Algorithmic Complexity Calculator** that automatically scores project requests (Small vs. Large scale) to prevent budget inflation.
- **The Master Plan Module:** An ERP dashboard that aggregates data from 8+ domains to visualize the "Gap Analysis" between strategic goals and actual implementation using dynamic Spider Charts.
- **The Index Evaluation Module:** A maturity assessment tool using a **Weighted Composite Index** to score agencies against national standards.

## **Engineering Highlight: Algorithmic Decision Support**

The suite's value lies in removing human bias through code.

- **The "Complexity Engine" (`App\Complexity::calculate`):** I wrote a weighted scoring algorithm that processes **8 technical vectors** (e.g., integration potential, user concurrency, database scale). It applies conditional multipliers (e.g., 2x for >50 tables) to mathematically classify projects, ensuring objective budget allocation.
- **Polymorphic Data Aggregation:** The Evaluation System uses a **Polymorphic Design Pattern** to calculate maturity scores. The same calculation logic (`morphTo`) is reused across different entity levels (Provincial → Regency → Agency), adhering strictly to DRY principles while handling massive hierarchical data.
