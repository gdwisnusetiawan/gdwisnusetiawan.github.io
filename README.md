### 🚀 Founder-Engineer | Build from Home • Adventure Anywhere

I bridge the gap between **technical execution** and **business strategy**. With **6+ years of experience** shipping code for governments, enterprises, and startups, I specialize in building scalable architectures, automating complex business logic, and deploying production-ready systems that solve real-world problems.

Currently, I am a **Software Engineer at McEasy**, transforming logistics operations with code.
